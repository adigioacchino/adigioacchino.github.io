I am a postdoc (more precisely, a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)) in the physics department of École Normale Supérieure in Paris, in the group led by [Simona Cocco](http://www.lps.ens.fr/~cocco/) and [Rémi Monasson](http://www.phys.ens.fr/~monasson/).
My research consists mainly in using methods and ideas from statistical physics and inference to deal with problems from the realm of biology (mostly related to protein/RNA/DNA analysis and design, genomics, evolution). [Here](/pages/research) a more detailed discussion of my scientific interests and results.

### * Talk at JIPS conference in Paris
I will give a talk on our statistical physics techniques applied to the study of pressures shaping nucleotide usage in viruses and their hosts, at the _Journées Interdisciplinaires de Physique Statistique_ (JIPS) conference on March 30$\phantom{}^{\text{th}}$! Registration and more info are available in the [conference website](https://sites.google.com/view/lptms-jips/home).

### * New preprint out! (06 December 2022)
Our new preprint is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.519259v1). We show how to use an implementation of transfer learning on Restricted Boltzmann Machines to analyze the changes between two datasets, and we apply this idea to predict antigen immunogenicity and T-cell receptor specificity, two well-known open problems in immunology. Check it out!

### * Conference IARANA in Paris on 27/28 June
We organized a conference in Paris about Innate and Adaptive Recognition of Antigens and NeoAntigens, more info at the [conference website](https://sites.google.com/view/qbio-iarana/home-page).
