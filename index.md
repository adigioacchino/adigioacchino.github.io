I am a postdoc (more precisely, a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)) in the physics department of École Normale Supérieure in Paris, in the group led by [Simona Cocco](http://www.lps.ens.fr/~cocco/) and [Rémi Monasson](http://www.phys.ens.fr/~monasson/).
My research consists mainly in using methods and ideas from statistical physics and inference to deal with problems from the realm of biology (mostly related to protein/RNA/DNA analysis and design, genomics, evolution). [Here](/pages/research) a more detailed discussion of my scientific results and interests.
