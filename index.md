I am a data scientist at [phagos](https://www.phagos.org/), a startup that aims at unlocking a cleaner, more sustainable future by using bacteriaâ€™s natural predator, the bacteriophage, to win the fight against antibiotic resistance and to cure infectious diseases in animal farming.
Together with our amazing team, I analyze data from our experiments and develop algorithms to improve our understanding of the phage-bacteria interaction and to find better phages to be used as antibiotics.

[Here](/pages/research) a more detailed discussion of my scientific interests and results.
