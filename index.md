I currently work as a **data scientist** at [phagos](https://www.phagos.org/), a startup that aims at unlocking a cleaner, more sustainable future by using bacteriaâ€™s natural predator, the *bacteriophage* (or simply phage), to win the fight against **antibiotic resistance** and to **cure infectious diseases** in animal farming.
Together with our amazing team, I analyze data from our experiments and develop algorithms to improve our understanding of the phage-bacteria interaction and to find better phages to be used as antibiotics.

[Here](/pages/research) a more detailed discussion of my scientific interests and results.
