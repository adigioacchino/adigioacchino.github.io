I am a postdoc (more precisely, a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)) in the physics department of École Normale Supérieure in Paris, in the group led by [Simona Cocco](http://www.lps.ens.fr/~cocco/) and [Rémi Monasson](http://www.phys.ens.fr/~monasson/).
My research consists mainly in using methods and ideas from statistical physics and inference to deal with problems from the realm of biology (mostly related to protein/RNA/DNA analysis and design, genomics, evolution). [Here](/pages/research) a more detailed discussion of my scientific interests and results.

### * New preprint out! (12  December 2022)
Our new preprint is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.04.467016v2). 
We analyze the human genome using statistical-physics inspired computational tools to detect regions (which in most cases are in the so-called "non-coding genome") that have viral-like patterns, and that could play a role in interacting with the innate immune system. We also discuss their evolution within and outside the human genome, pointing out cases where possibly immunogenic patterns seems to be conserved during genome evolution or across organisms.
Check it out!

### * Talk at JIPS conference in Paris
I will give a talk on our statistical physics techniques applied to the study of pressures shaping nucleotide usage in viruses and their hosts, at the _Journées Interdisciplinaires de Physique Statistique_ (JIPS) conference on March 30$\phantom{}^{\text{th}}$! Registration and more info are available in the [conference website](https://sites.google.com/view/lptms-jips/home).

### * New preprint out! (06 December 2022)
Our new preprint is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.519259v1). We show how to use an implementation of transfer learning on Restricted Boltzmann Machines to analyze the changes between two datasets, and we apply this idea to predict antigen immunogenicity and T-cell receptor specificity, two well-known open problems in immunology. Check it out!

### * Conference IARANA in Paris on 27/28 June
We organized a conference in Paris about Innate and Adaptive Recognition of Antigens and NeoAntigens, more info at the [conference website](https://sites.google.com/view/qbio-iarana/home-page).
